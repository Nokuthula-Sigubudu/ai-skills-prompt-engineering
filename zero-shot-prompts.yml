Dear Stakeholders,
I hope you're well.
Iâ€™d like to inform you of a brief adjustment to the timeline for our WhatsApp integration project. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen technical challenges, the delivery date will be extended by two weeks.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and continued support. Our priority remains delivering a robust and reliable solution, and weâ€™re committed to maintaining full transparency throughout the process.
